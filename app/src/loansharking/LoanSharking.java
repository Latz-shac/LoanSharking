/**
 * Lab assignment for Databases II (Spring 2008)
 * Intermediate studies @ University of Turku
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate utilization of a database
 * using Java and its database features. Assignment functions a database
 * application which is used by various 'godfathers' of organized crime to
 * keep track of debt collection.
 * <p>
 * The main entities are:
 * - Customer (payer)
 * - Godfather (payee)
 * - Goon (one who ensures the debt is paid)
 * - Debt
 * <p>
 * This application has, however, omitted user authentication since the
 * main point is in the database handling.
